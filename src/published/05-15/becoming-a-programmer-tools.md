### 1 - Use a lag-free computer
If you are going to become a programmer, you are going to spend lots of time in front of a computer, there is nothing worse than breaking your flow or losing your mind because your laptop keeps freeing or lagging. If your computer is running so slow that you can notice it, I would advise running an ubuntu partition, you can even do this from a [USB](http://www.pendrivelinux.com/). Ubuntu will feel strange to somebody who has only ever used windows to start with but it will run multitudes smoother than windows on old computers.

 If you do not want to go down that road then look into investing in a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), the Â£30 computer designed to run everything you need to learn to how to code.

### 2 - Learn to use a terminal
Get familiar with the terminal (command prompt for windows uers), you will need this if you wish to get the most out of developer tools, such as the source control system [git](https://git-scm.com/) or any package managers (eg. [apt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool), [yum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowdog_Updater,_Modified), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [brew](http://brew.sh/) ).

As the terminal is about as close as you can get to your computer, you can do almost anything here from adding a new file to your project to deleting your entire operating system. I use the terminal mainly for running programs that I write, services that I need and controlling what I install.

### 3 - Find a text editor
During the beginning of your programming career you will most likely use an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as Visual Studio, Netbeans or Eclipse. These are very useful while you are focusing on writing code and don't actually care what happens behind the scenes, but they are usually quite heavyweight, slow and sometimes unhelpful. Text editors are the solution by allowing you to write basically whatever you want and usually just giving you basic help such as syntax highlighting with the optional additions of extensions and plugins to help out where needed.

The great thing about text editors is that you can use one editor for all languages whereas IDEs usually only support a handful of languages each so you have to be able to switch between them as you switch between languages.

In a recent survey of 16,778 developers, the most popular text editors were [NotePad++ ](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (34.7%) and [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) (25.2%), both of which are nice for beginners as they are basic and easy to use, personally I use [Atom](https://atom.io/) (2.8%) because even though it is quite new, the quick keys and easy access menus make it really nice to program with.

### 4 - Find a friend
Programming is hard, that is why some people can spend weeks attempting to learn and get nowhere. Although when you start, out most of your programming time will be spent by yourself, in a class or looking through the internet, it is very useful to find at least one friend or ideally a group of friends that enjoy programming very similar stuff to you.

 If you have a group of friends then getting stuck is a lot less scary as you can enlist people to look at your problem and there is a good chance that they have either seen this problem before or between you, you can come up with a solution or workaround. In my opinion, this is the most important tool in a programmers kit.
