# blog.martynrushton.com

## Premise
This is a platform for me to write my thoughts and ideas down. The main aim is to see how I progress as a programmer.

## To Do

### Styling
- The styling is currently lacking. This site needs to be styled with a similar feel to the root site (martynrushton.com) in mind. Keep it simple.
- I would like to give the archive page either a similar tiled effect that I have been using on other sites, or look into other ways of styling.
- I would like to make the home page (blog.martynrushton.com/) display the full posts of the last 10 posts.
### Metalsmith Plugins
- Feed : An RSS feed
- Word Count : A word count and estimated reading time - already included, just needs implementing.

### Tags/Topics
- Tags and topic pages both need more styling applied. Apply the same 'tiled' theme to both as I have started to on topics.
- Tags should be title followed by summary.
