# blog.martynrushton.com

## Premise
This is a platform for me to write my thoughts and ideas down. The main aim is to see how I progress as a programmer.

## To Do

### Styling
The styling is currently none. This site needs to be styled with a similar feel to the root site (martynrushton.com) in mind. Keep it simple
###Â URL rewrite
Currently, when following the tag link you get a '/tags/<tag>.html', I would like to remove the .html. The internet says that this can be done with a
.htaccess file. This is server side technology and I would like to look into it.
