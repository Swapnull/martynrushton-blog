# martynrushton-blog

## Premise
This is a platform for me to write my thoughts and ideas down. The main aim is to see how I progress as a programmer

## Building
If you wish to recreate my site, you will need to install the packages and generate the build file by running

    $ npm install
    $ npm start

This will create everything and start the server on [port 1337](http://localhost:1337/).

## Tools & Further Development
I have used the metalsmith framework for this blog, you can find how I have set it up in the metalsmith.json and metalsmith-config.js files. I have also used some handlebars templating which can be found in handlebars-helpers.js.

If you happen to use some of this code please give a link back to "www.martynrushton.com" in the comments somewhere on your site, this is not required but appreciated.
